Well, lately I had some thoughts about tax. Did it ever occur to you that we are paying more and more and more tax?

Apart from the fact that tax rates are going higher and higher (if you take a look at the last 50 years or so and compare) let's look at this as well:
- We pay income tax. 
- Then, with the money left over we buy things - and pay VAT - 17 1/2 percent, again taken out of the left over.
- In addition we pay road tax for our car, 170 pounds a year
- plus 42 pence of tax on every Liter we put in. That can add up to another few thousand a year.
- Then till recently I was smoking. Big tax there, at least another grand a year, just on the tax on the pack of fags.
- And then there is tax on alcohol
- Then I was about to buy a house and there is "stamp duty"....

OK, Too much already!
