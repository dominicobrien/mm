Just had this idea which could be kind of cool:

Make a list the names of all the people I lost track off on my blog. They are bound to search for themselves one day and - Voila - they stumble across my site where they can get in touch - if they want.

On Facebook & co they have to look for me specifically or accidentally get somehow linked to mem.

This way it's not necessary.
