Some girl I met the other day told me (subject to verification, but makes sense) that every 6th person in the UK, works for the government!

I was shocked.

No wonder we pay that much tax in this country!

This is way too many people and this needs to be limited. I believe 5% of people working for government should be absolute maximum (every 20th person).

Otherwise the purpose of the government becomes to justify it's existence (as it often does) and gets in the way of the rest of the population getting anything done.
