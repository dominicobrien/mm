Who is aware of the new ID Card bill that UK labour government is trying to push through?

If you are not aware of it, wake up and get informed and do something about it. 

This bill is the beginning of the end as far as your personal freedoms are concerned.

This claim this pretty upfront. Why?

There are many arguments already in circulation. Here are two that I feel are the most senior and most often overlooked.

Firstly there is this: With all the rules in the world to prevent misuse by government or other sources, who can guaranty these rules in the future? 

What I am saying is that once the system to control the population in its entirety is in place, who is to guaranty its proper use from here on out into eternity?

The risks and potential damages that can occur from misuse are beyond what most people are willing to face up to. Look at it this way, if the regime of the Third Reich would have had an ID card system in place like is currently planned, the resistance would have had no chance. That would have been the end of the free world as without resistance working from the inside, Britain would not have won the war.

So, why risk it; risk it to put a system in place whereby total control is possible?

Who can guaranty what powers are going to be in power in 100 years? Anyone want to take full responsibility for that one?

There is another reason, normally completely overlooked by governments and anyone concerned: Software security. 

I am not going to say much about it but just pose some questions and you can think about it for yourself and come up with your own answers.

Did you know that anyone who would have unrestricted access to a system like this would control the country? Think about it.

Did you know that the software for such an monstrous ID Card application would need to be written or has already been written? By whom? Who can guaranty its integrity? Who could side check millions of lines of code and find a backdoor that a clever programmer would have wanted to put in and wanted to hide? Any takers?

On the risk of getting of the subject, did you know that (at the time of this writing) the software in use by financial institutions has had no such check? They will tell you otherwise, but do your own research.

The only system that would even get close would be complete open source so it could be reviewed by the world. But then, who would ensure only approved open source software would be used?

So, listen, citizens of the world!

If anyone ever tries to put an ID card system in place like this, fight it to the end - and win. 

REFUSE IT. DO NOT ALLOW IT. 

For the sake of yourself, your children and your children's children. I beg you.
